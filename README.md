# README.md

I am a young professional keen on helping businesses leverage technology tools to reduce inefficiencies while increasing both productivity and profitability. Over the years, I have established a successful track record in building innovative digital experiences for profitable enterprises.

> I live by a simple motto: _"From one thing, you must know ten thousand things"_.

### A bit about me

Having worked in a wide range of industries offering visible improvements aided by technologies, I have crafted solid production-grade systems, trained staff and supported business processes. All this has helped my client firms unlocked latent profits, and better serve their customers (direct and otherwise). I am actively learning to build systems capable of creating value from information produced in Africa, to support these businesses even further.

Currently I operate the [ninte.dev](https://ninte.dev) brand as a Business Technology Consultant.
