### A bit about me

I cofounded [JidiTrust](https://github.com/Usheninte/jiditrust-mvp) in 2020, a startup offering business management tools and financial literacy education in African local dialects. This was done during my time as an Entrepreneur-in-Training at [MEST Africa](https://meltwater.org/).

Currently I operate the [ninte.dev](https://ninte.dev) brand as a Software Development Consultant. I am actively learning to build systems capable of creating value from information produced on the African continent.

Periodically, I write articles on [blog.ninte.dev](https://blog.ninte.dev) around the concepts I find interesting.
