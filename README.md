### Entrepreneurial Profile

I cofounded [JidiTrust](https://github.com/Usheninte/jiditrust-mvp) in 2020, a startup offering business management tools and financial literacy education in African local dialects. This was done during my time in training at one of Africa's foremost **Software Entrepreneurship** institutions.

Currently I operate the [ninte.dev](https://ninte.dev) brand as a Proprietor. I am actively learning Data Analysis and related Software Development practices needed to build systems capable of creating value from information produced on the African continent.
