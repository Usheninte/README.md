Hello world, my name is **Usheninte Dangana**.

I am a Software Engineer interested in Innovation, the Creative Arts and Entrepreneurship, with strong skills in Leadership and Intercultural Communication. 

My fields of focus are Web Engineering and Data Analytics. With regard to Web Engineering, in particular, I have established a successful track record in building innovative digital experiences for profitable enterprises. 

Learning is of significant interest to me and I constantly think toward the future. I periodically write articles around the concepts I find interesting [here](https://blog.ninte.dev).

Currently an Entrepreneur-In-Training at [MEST Africa](https://meltwater.org/), I study and implement the principles for building scalable businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). 

After gaining experience tutoring individuals in Software Development as a pioneer [Developer Students Club](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc) Lead in SSA, I am currently a Mentor and Alumnus for the program. This initiative was in many ways my introduction to Google Cloud and its related technologies.

I live by a simple motto: _"From one thing, you must know ten thousand things"_. 

Conversations about commerce in emerging markets, professional development and building solutions for businesses are quite interesting to me, and I happily engage when able.
